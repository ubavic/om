			Taking into consideration that in all electrical devices, electricity performs work, it seems somewhat unusual that the most common component in these devices is actually a <em>resistor</em>,
			a component that in some way "slows down" electric current. More precisely, a resistor is a component with two terminals that has a certain <em>electrical resistance</em>,
			the property of opposing the flow of current through the component when a potential difference (voltage) is applied across the terminals. Electrical resistance is the ratio of applied voltage
			to the current flowing through the component and is measured in Ohms (Ω), a unit named after the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm.
		</p>
		<p>
			As current flows through a resistor, the potential energy of electrons is lost (i.e., there is a voltage drop), converting this energy into the thermal energy of the resistor's molecules. This
			property can be utilized in various ways in electrical circuits: limiting the current, reducing signals, dividing voltages, etc. Therefore, it is important to know the exact resistance of each individual resistor,
			as well as how this resistance changes depending on the resistor's temperature. These values depend on the material properties of the resistor and its manufacturing method, as well as uncontrollable variations.
		</p>
		<p>
			The resistance of any object, including a resistor, can be measured using an <em>ohmmeter</em>, but it is often useful to know the resistance by inspecting the resistor itself. Thus, the resistance of a component
			placed in a device cannot be precisely measured unless the component is removed (disassembled) from the device. Various markings indicating its resistance are placed on resistors. On cylindrical resistors,
			resistance is marked with three or more color bands. This application allows the user to decipher these markings by selecting colors.
		</p>
		<p>
			In resistors with three bands, the first two bands represent decimals, while the third band represents the multiplier. The error in manufacturing for such resistors is not small and can be considered that the
			resistance is up to 20% higher or lower than the marked value. In resistors with four markings, the first three markings represent the same as in three-band resistors, and the fourth marking represents tolerance
			to the described error. In resistors with five markings, the first three markings represent decimals, while the fourth and fifth represent the multiplier and tolerance, respectively. Finally, in resistors with six markings,
			the sixth marking represents the change in resistance with a change in temperature and is expressed in millionths of Ohms per degree Celsius (<em>parts per million</em>).
		</p>
		<p>
			A resistor is always read from the marking that is closer to one of the terminals. If the markings are symmetrically arranged on the resistor, there are likely silver or gold markings, which are known not to represent a digit.
			The resistor is non-polarized and can be placed in the circuit in any orientation.
